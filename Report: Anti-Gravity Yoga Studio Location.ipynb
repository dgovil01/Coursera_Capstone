Their respective result dataframes and combined visual give an overview of the neighborhoods for our startup business.\n2. We conducted a search query for all types of fitness centers in each neighborhood coordinate with a radius of 10km and sufficient limit to cover all poosible types of activity centers that exist there. The dataframe is used to show all the results (1203) with all the details of interest including name, address, distance from Manhattan main, postal codes, and geographical coordinates. A count of these fitness centers is obtained to see the total number of these centers in each Manhattan neighborhood. An ascending ordered list by counts gives us neighborhoods with minimum occurences of any type of fitness centers first and so on. This gives us a list of neighborhoods with minimum to maximum density of activity centers. \n3. Finally, we apply the machine learning technique of KMeans Clustering to refine our results from the above two actions. We have the neighborhoods with minimum density but we are looking for areas closest possible to Manhattan main as well. Applying KMeans clustering gives us 5 clusters of fitness centers.\n    Cluster 1: Consists of the activity centers, mostly farthest from Manhattan main, and closely packed with each other.\n    Cluster 2: Consists of activity centers relatively less distanced from Manhattan main.\n    Cluster 3, 4, & 5 do a better job of isolating neighborhood with desired attributes.\n",

Inclusion of per-family-income by   neighborhoods is recommended. More affluent neighborhoods are likely to try new yoga styles like the aerial yoga. \n2. The retail apocalypse, in recent years, is a blessing for small startup businesses. Increasing number of store closures has forced landlords to allow short-term leases for pop-up businesses.
